# CSC 578 Kaggle Submission Code

The following submission was used to create the winning entry in the Kaggle competition for the 6th homework assginment for CSC 578, Neural Networks and Deep Learning, at DePaul University.

This submission has been shared with the permission of the professor to assist with training neural networks for the final project.

The code is relatively well documented and does list the necessary dependencies to run.

The particular library being leveraged for the optimization is Scikit-Optimize - https://scikit-optimize.github.io/
